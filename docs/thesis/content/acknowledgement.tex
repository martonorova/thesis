I would like to thank all the people, who helped me during the semester to prepare this thesis, without being exhaustive. My advisor, Dr. Zoltán Szatmári, who guided me through the work and gave countless professional advice in order to ensure the success of the project. I thank my colleagues at RapidMiner for providing me with many practical suggestions. I would also like to thank my roommates, Balázs Prehoda and Kornél Tamás, who constantly motivated me with their hard work and commitment concerning their own thesis projects. Finally, I would like to thank Eszter Zsubori for helping me revise the stylistics of this work.
